# goit-react-hw-01-components

The `goit-react-hw-01-components` repository has been created.
The components of all tasks are rendered on the same page, inside a common container - the root `<App>` component.
Each component has a separate folder with a React component file and a stylesheet.
For all components propTypes are described.
Everything that the component expects in the form of props is passed to it when it is called.
Styling is done by CSS Modules.

## 1 - Social network profile

The `Profile` component has been created, with the help of which we can display information about a user of a social network. User data is stored in the `user.json` file.

- `id` - unique transaction ID
- `type` â€” transaction type
